# Employee-Payroll-Tracker
Welcome to the Employee Payroll Tracker!
This website will provide the page where you can add any employees you want, with their first name, last name and salary in a dropbox when you click the "Add Employees".
I learned how to create prompt and confirm boxes to give messages of what to type in the boxes in preparation to add information in answering questions when prompted.
My project will help with creating forms and pop up windows for people to answer them before they move on.
You can also see the information about the people who are recorded into the array when you inspect the console on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsft Edge of your choice.
